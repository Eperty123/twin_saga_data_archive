48101|Angriff|Haupt-Stats: ANG, KRIT

Rohe Gewalt, das ist die effizienteste Art zu kämpfen! Heize dem Gegner mit ein paar ordentlichen Hieben ein und setze dein strahlendstes Gewinnerlächeln auf, wenn du siegreich über ihm stehst.||||
48102|Schutz|Haupt-Stats: Max. LP, VTG

Mit dem Rücken zur Wand bringen dir auch die härtesten Faustschläge nichts mehr. Alles, was dich nun noch retten kann, ist eine gute Abwehr! An einer so harten Schale zu kratzen, zehrt jeden Gegner aus!||||
48103|Arkan|Haupt-Stats: KRIT, Max. LP

Aus Magischer Energie Barrieren erschaffen, die Angriffe abwehren und eigene Skills boosten? Gar kein Problem! Diese Magier haben ganz schön was auf dem Kasten.||||
48104|Element|Haupt-Stats: ANG, GES

Das Zaubertempo und die Macht von Element-Magiern können sich wirklich sehen lassen. Als Herrscher über die Kraft der Natur sind sie eine Bereicherung für jedes Team!||||
48105|Reflex|Haupt-Stats: GES, ANG

Aus völlig unmöglichen Situationen heraus noch einen Treffer ins Schwarze landen? Entgegen aller Regeln der Physik kämpfen? Ja, darin sind diese Reflex-Schützen wahre Meister.||||
48106|Präzision|Haupt-Stats: KRIT, AUSW

Profundes Wissen über jede Waffe und in der Lage, selbst Munition herzustellen ... das sind Präzision-Schützen! Sie landen tödliche Treffer und verschwinden dann wieder in den Schatten.||||
48107|Hingabe|Haupt-Stats: Max. LP, VTG

Die Welt von allem Leid erlösen und das allein durch ihre himmlischen Gesänge? Ja, genau das ist die Spezialität von Hingabe-Klerikern.||||
48108|Disziplin|Haupt-Stats: GES, ANG

Disziplin-Kleriker verstehen es wie niemand sonst, ihre Verbündeten durch aufmunternde Worte zu stärken und einen einzelnen Mann wie drei Bullen kämpfen zu lassen!||||
48109|Morgengrauen|Haupt-Stats: VTG, Max. LP

Sie schützen ihre Verbündeten mit ihrem Leben und genau dafür sind sie perfekt gerüstet. Die Morgengrauen-Paladine sind wertvolle Mitglieder für jede Truppe.||||
48110|Dämmerung|Haupt-Stats: GES, ANG

Wer würde es wagen, einem Dämmerung-Paladin samt seiner scharfen Klinge die Stirn zu bieten? Nur lebensmüde Narren, so viel steht fest.||||
48111|Intuition|Haupt-Stats: ANG, GES

Nerven aus Stahl und den Bogen in sicheren Händen gespannt: Der Intuition-Jäger wurde nicht umsonst von der Erdgöttin persönlich auserwählt, für das Gute zu kämpfen.||||
48112|Scharfsicht|Haupt-Stats: KRIT, VTG

Ein Schuss und das Blatt hat sich gewendet? So etwas kann nur der Scharfsicht-Jäger, der sowohl im Angriff als auch in der Verteidigung ein wahrer Experte ist.||||
48113|Geist|Haupt-Stats: KRIT, Max. LP

Als Nachfahre berühmt-berüchtigter Assassinen, die die Kunst der kritischen Attacken und schnellen Heilung gemeistert haben, ist der Geist-Schurke ein besonders tödlicher Gegner.||||
48114|Schatten|Haupt-Stats: AUSW, ANG

Gerade war er noch hier, jetzt ist er wieder weg und der Feind mit einem bösen Zauber belegt? Da war ein Schatten-Schurke am Werk.||||
48115|Fluch|Haupt-Stats: ANG, KRIT

Fluch-Okkultisten sind Meister ihrer Kampfkunst. Sie belegen den Feind mit einem bösen Zauber und sehen dann dabei zu, wie es sie langsam hinwegrafft.||||
48116|Illusion|Haupt-Stats: VTG, AUSW

Ein paar gemurmelte Worte, die die eigene Verteidigung erhöhen und den Feind mit seinen tiefsten Ängsten konfrontiert? Die Tat eines Illusion-Okkultisten, keine Frage.||||
48117|Wut|Haupt-Stats: KRIT, ANG

Ein feuriger Hieb hier, ein heftiger Tritt da. Einen Wut-Berserke auf seiner Seite zu haben, kann definitiv nicht schaden. Ist er jedoch dein Gegner, nimm besser die Beine in die Hand.||||
48118|Blut|Haupt-Stats: Max. LP, VTG

Wer einen langen Atem beweist, wird am Ende die Früchte seiner Arbeit ernten! Nach diesem Motto lebt der Blut-Berserker, der jeden Feind auszehrt.||||
48119|Stolz|Haupt-Stats: KRIT, VTG

Die Lanze immer kampfbereit, die Sinne geschärft ... das ist der Stolz-Drachenkrieger, ein Meister des Angriffs und der Verteidigung.||||
48120|Ehre|Haupt-Stats: ANG, Max. LP

Mit der Ausdauer und Kraft eines ausgewachsenen Drachen kommt der Ehre-Drachenkrieger daher. Wer wagt es, sich ihm entgegenzustellen?||||
48121|Schutz|Er lebt für den Kampf und er überlebt jeden Kampf! So ist die Devise des Schutz-Schwertkämpfers.||||
48122|Voodoo|Ein Meister der Elemente und Zerstörung, das beschreibt den Voodoo-Magier ganz gut. Mit seinen vernichtenden Zaubern ist er eine wahre Bereicherung.||||
48123|Taktik|Wer kann einen Schwert-Revolver schwingen, als wäre es sein dritter Arm? Ein Taktik-Schütze natürlich! Und genau das macht ihn so brandgefährlich.||||
48124|Erlösung|Wie das wohl ist, jeden Funken heiliger Energie zu seinen eigenen Gunsten nutzen zu können? Das kann nur ein Erlösung-Kleriker beantworten, denn darin ist er ein Meister.||||
48125|Zwielicht|Wer in die Reihen der Zwielicht-Paladine aufgenommen werden will, muss sich erst beweisen! Diese loyalen und mächtigen Krieger nehmen nicht jeden auf.||||
48126|Treibjagd|Der Legende nach, sollen Treibjagd-Jäger dazu in der Lage sein, die Sonne mit ihren Schüssen zu erreichen, weil sie so geschickt sind. Ob das stimmt?||||
48127|Leere|Wenn ein Leere-Schurke sich ein Opfer gesucht hat, dann wird dieses Opfer auch dran glauben müssen. Aller Vorsichtsmaßnahmen und Bodyguards zum Trotz, entkommt ihm niemand.||||
48128|Chaos|Jeder Schritt, jedes Wort, jede Geste hat Einfluss auf seine Umgebung: Der Chaos-Okkultist kontrolliert mühelos jeden Organismus, der seinen Weg kreuzt.||||
48129|Vernichtung|Einem Vernichtung-Berserker macht man so leicht nichts vor: Als Veteran tausender Schlachten weiß er, wie man richtig kämpft. Selbst, wenn er sich allein gegen dutzende Feinde beweisen muss.||||
48130|Gnade|Gnade-Drachenkrieger durchfließt das Blut und die Erinnerung ihrer feuerspeienden Vorfahren. Von dieser Macht erfüllt, stellen sie sich ganzen Armeen ohne mit der Wimper zu zucken.||||
48131|Rakshasa|Primärstats: ANG, Max. LP

Als religiöser Anhänger hast du lange Zeit in Einsamkeit verbracht. Jetzt bist du gehärtet und gestärkt zurückgekehrt du bist eins mit der Natur!||||
48132|Yaksha|Primärstats: KRIT, AUSW

Deine Fäuste sind deine tödlichste Waffe und dein Körper ist härter als eine Wand. Viele haben behauptet, jemand wie du existiere nur in Mythen und Legenden. Du hast sie vom Gegenteil überzeugt.||||
48133|Asura|Der Kampf liegt dir im Blut. Jeder Muskel in deinem Körper ist zum Töten da. Auf dem Schlachtfeld bist du der schlimmste Alptraum deiner Gegner.||||
48134|Magier der Gestalt|Haupt-Stats: ANG, Max. LP

Elemente fließen durch den Körper. Kontrollierte Energie bündelt sich im Waffenfeuer und entscheidet den Krieg. Diese erarbmungslose Artillerie kann die Welt zerstören.||||
48135|Shatterproof Artillery|Main Attributes: CRIT, EVA

A combination of proficiency with all elements. Energy is used to its maximum limit. The weapon exceeds traditional engineering constraints and brings the rhythm of battle under your control.||||
48136|Incorporeal Artillery|The elements of the world combine and the entire planet becomes my weapon. The direction of the muzzle becomes the guarantee of triumph. I am a God!||||
48137|Errant|Main Attributes: Attack, Max HP

They're not chasing after stronger swordsmanship, but rather, the core essence of swordsmanship. They do not realize that their swordsmanship has reached its peak perfection...||||
48138|Champion|Main Attributes: Critical Strike, Evasion

The warriors enhance their swordsmanship through countless battles. They feel the power of the sword surging in their soul.||||
48139|Fleeting Warble|The sword is not just a weapon in your hands, it's an extension of your soul. Your existence is the sword itself. Your sword may slice through everything because of this strong will.||||
